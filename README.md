# RNode Configuration Utility

## Introduction

Configure, update, flash, backup and install your [RNode](https://unsigned.io/projects/rnode/) (homebrew or official) with this handy utility.

RNode is a flexible LoRa-based transceiver, and this tool allows you to install and configure RNodes built on a variety of different platforms and boards. With this tool you can configure and update existing RNodes, or make your own RNodes from supported boards and modules.

## Supported Devices
Currently the RNode Configuration Utility supports:

- The original RNode from [unsigned.io](https://unsigned.io/)
- Homebrew RNodes based on ATmega1284p boards
- Homebrew RNodes based on ATmega2560 boards
- Homebrew RNodes based on Adafruit Feather ESP32 boards
- Homebrew RNodes based on generic ESP32 boards
- LilyGO T-Beam v1.1 devices
- LilyGO LoRa32 v2.0 devices
- LilyGO LoRa32 v2.1 devices
- Heltec LoRa32 v2 devices

You can use the included autoinstaller to automatically install and provision the RNode firmware on any supported board.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the configuration utility is with pip:

```sh
# If you don't already have pip installed
sudo apt install python3-pip

# Install rnodeconf with pip
pip3 install rnodeconf

# Run rnodeconf
rnodeconf --help
```

**Please Note**: If this is the very first time you use pip to install a program on your system, you might need to reboot your system for your program to become available. If you get a __command not found__ error or similar when running the program, reboot your system and try again. If this still doesn't work, you will need to add the pip install directory to your PATH variable. The best way to do this is to edit the ".profile" file in your home directory and add the following lines at the bottom of the file:

```sh
# Include locally installed programs in path
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

## Usage Overview

RNode can operate in two modes, host-controlled (default) and TNC mode:

- When RNode is in host-controlled mode, it will stay in standby when powered on, until the host specifies frequency, bandwidth, transmit power and other required parameters. This mode can be enabled by using the -N option of this utility.

- When RNode is in TNC mode, it will configure itself on powerup and enable the radio immediately. This mode can be enabled by using the -T option of this utility (the utility will guide you through the settings if you don't specify them directly).

For a complete description of RNodes capabilities, documentation and more, please refer to the [RNode repository](https://github.com/markqvist/RNode_Firmware).

## Command Examples

### Show device info

Print info like serial number, hardware revision, model and firmware version.

```sh
rnodeconf /dev/ttyUSB0 -i
```

### Update the firmware

Grab the latest precompiled firmware from the RNode Firmware repository and flash it to the device.

```sh
rnodeconf /dev/ttyUSB0 -u
```

### Start the autoinstaller

Start the autoinstallation guide for turning a compatible device into an RNode.

```sh
rnodeconf --autoinstall
```

### Set RNode to TNC mode

If you just specify the -T option, the utility will ask you for the necessary parameters.

```sh
rnodeconf /dev/ttyUSB0 -T
```

You can also specify all the options on the command line.

```sh
rnodeconf /dev/ttyuUSB0 -T --freq 868000000 --bw 125000 --txp 2 --sf 7 --cr 5
```

### Set RNode to host-controlled mode

Use the -N option to set the device to host-controlled mode.

```sh
rnodeconf /dev/ttyUSB0 -N
```
